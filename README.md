Clean Boot is a minimal less framework based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap includes several bloated features that I don't often use. Our goal is to create a framework with the following features:

 * Full Fetured Grid
 * Basic Element Styling
 * Variables for Rapidly Styling Elements

We are working to open this up to the community soon.
